# activemq_js_consumer

## How to Run?

from command line, use the following command:

	mvn clean tomcat7:run -Dohadr.project.port=8093

Note that 'ohadr.project.port' is a property that lets you set the port that the application will be listening to. If none is set, the default port is 8080. You can use a different port that 8093, of course.
